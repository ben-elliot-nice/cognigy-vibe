## node-types — Quick Reference

This is an alias for flow-chart-reading + extension-map combined.

### Verified type strings (exact, case-sensitive)
  say               Speak text (config schema: explain("say-node"))
  code              JavaScript execution
  wait              Await user input
  once              First-turn gate (auto-creates onFirstExecution + afterwards children)

  httpRequest       Outbound HTTP
  setContext        Set context variables
  if                Conditional (NOT "ifThenElse") — create via cognigy_create

  lookup            Pattern-match branch
  setSessionConfig  Voice Gateway config (extension: @cognigy/voicegateway2)
