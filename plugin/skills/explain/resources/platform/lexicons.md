## lexicons — No Verified Body Shape Yet

No confirmed `cognigy_create`/`cognigy_update` body shape exists for
`resource_type="lexicons"` in this codebase — no live-verified example and no
working code reference to draw from. Do not guess field names.

### Discovery recipe
1. If a lexicon already exists in the target project, read its real shape:
   `cognigy_list(resource_type="lexicons", project_id="<projectId>", full_objects=true)`
2. Fall back to describe_resource_schema(resource_type="lexicons", operation="create") —
   it looks up the field-level shape directly from the live OpenAPI spec (no session
   cookie needed, just the same API key already configured).

### Once you confirm a working shape
File it back as an amendment to this topic (or a dedicated one) so the next
session doesn't repeat this discovery from scratch — see this repo's CLAUDE.md
documentation-workflow rule.
