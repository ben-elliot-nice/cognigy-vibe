## knowledge-store — Managing Knowledge Sources

### Resource hierarchy
Project → KnowledgeStore → Sources → Chunks

### Prerequisite: project-level Generative AI settings

Before creating a knowledge store, the project must have an embedding model activated for the
`knowledgeSearch` use-case:

```
assign_org_llm { project_id: "<projectId>", llm_id: "<embedding llm _id>" }
set_project_generative_ai_settings {
  project_id: "<projectId>",
  use_case_settings: { "knowledgeSearch": "<embedding llm _id>" }
}
```

Assigning an embedding LLM to the project via `assign_org_llm` alone is **not** sufficient —
without the `set_project_generative_ai_settings` call, knowledge-store creation and retrieval
silently fail to use the intended embedding model. See `explain("llm-resources")` for the full
mechanism, including how to read back the current `knowledgeSearch` assignment to verify this
prerequisite is met before creating a store.

### List knowledge stores
  cognigy_list(resource_type="knowledgestores", project_id=...)

### Create a source — manual (text chunks)
  cognigy_create(resource_type="knowledgestores/{ksId}/sources",
    body={"name": "My Source", "type": "manual"})

  INVALID fields (API returns 400):
  - knowledgeStoreId → not needed (ksId is already in the resource_type path)
  - content → not a create-time field; text is added as chunks after creation
  - type: "text" → not a valid type; use "manual"

### Add text chunks to a source
  After creating a manual source, add its text content as chunks:
  cognigy_create(resource_type="knowledgestores/{ksId}/sources/{sourceId}/chunks",
    body={"text": "The battery trade-in policy allows..."})
  Retrieve sourceId from the cognigy_create response (referenceId or follow with cognigy_list).

### Create a source — file upload (pdf/txt/ctxt)
  push_knowledge_source_file(file_path="/abs/path/policy.pdf", knowledge_store_id="<ksId>",
    tags=["demo", "sales"])  # tags optional

  This is a dedicated tool, not cognigy_invoke — cognigy_invoke only accepts JSON bodies and
  cannot perform the real multipart/form-data upload the API requires
  (POST /v2.0/knowledgestores/{ksId}/sources/upload). Guessing an operation name like
  "sources/upload" through cognigy_invoke returns an opaque 500, not a clear "unsupported" error.

  Supported formats: .pdf, .txt, .ctxt (anything else is rejected client-side before the API call).
  The response is a Task ({_id, status: queued|active|done|error, ...}) — ingestion runs
  asynchronously, so a "success" result means the upload started, not that chunking finished.
  Poll GET /v2.0/tasks/{taskId} (see the pattern in export_package's task polling,
  or cognigy_invoke) if you need to confirm ingestion completed before querying chunks.

### Trigger ingestion via connector
  cognigy_invoke(resource_type="knowledgestore", resource_id=<ksId>,
    operation="run", body={"connector_id": "<connectorId>"})
Path: POST /v2.0/knowledgestores/{ksId}/connectors/{connectorId}/run

### Query chunks (for debugging)
  Path: GET /v2.0/knowledgestores/{ksId}/sources/{sourceId}/chunks

### Using in a flow
Knowledge AI node references the knowledge store by ID.
Get the ID from state: resolve_resource(name="My Store", resource_type="knowledgestores")
