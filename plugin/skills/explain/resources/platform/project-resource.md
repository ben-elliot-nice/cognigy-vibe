## project-resource — No Verified Body Shape Yet

No confirmed `cognigy_create`/`cognigy_update` body shape exists for
`resource_type="project"` in this codebase — no live-verified example and no
working code reference to draw from. Do not guess field names.

### Discovery recipe
1. If a project already exists, read its real shape:
   `cognigy_list(resource_type="project", full_objects=true)`
2. Fall back to the OpenAPI spec (per this repo's CLAUDE.md, `./openapi.json`
   or fetched per-environment with a session cookie) as the authoritative
   schema reference — it is not wired into any MCP tool, so this is a manual
   step outside the current session.

### Once you confirm a working shape
File it back as an amendment to this topic (or a dedicated one) so the next
session doesn't repeat this discovery from scratch — see this repo's CLAUDE.md
documentation-workflow rule.
