## project-snapshots — Project Versioning via Snapshots

### Flow-level versioning does not exist
POST /v2.0/flows/{flowId}/versions returns 404. The "Save Version" button in the Cognigy UI
creates a project-level snapshot, not a flow-scoped version. There is no API for flow-scoped versioning.

### Create a project snapshot (captures entire project state)
  cognigy_create(resource_type="snapshot", body={
    "name": "Task 0 — Foundation",
    "description": "Baseline before AI Agent job additions",
    "projectId": "<projectId>"
  })

Required fields: name, description, projectId
"description" is required — omitting it returns HTTP 400.

### Response: async job (not the snapshot itself)
Snapshot creation is asynchronous. The response is a queued job:
  {
    "_id": "<jobId>",
    "status": "queued",
    "type": "createSnapshot",
    "progress": 0,
    "parameters": {
      "properties": {"name": "...", "description": "..."}
    }
  }
The jobId is NOT the snapshotId. The snapshot appears in the Cognigy UI once the job completes
(usually within a few seconds). There is no polling endpoint for job completion.

### List existing snapshots
  cognigy_list(resource_type="snapshots", project_id="<projectId>")
Returns: {"items": [...], "count": N}

### When to snapshot
Use at task completion milestones during multi-agent builds:
  - Before starting a major new component (safety checkpoint)
  - After a working demo state is confirmed (named "DEMO READY")
  - Before destructive operations (delete/replace flow nodes)

### Exporting a full project zip (offline backup / handoff)
Snapshots capture project state server-side; for a portable offline zip use `export_package`:
  export_package {
    project_id: "<projectId>",
    output_path: "$DEMO_DIR/<customer>-package.zip"  // $DEMO_DIR is build-orchestrator's resolved absolute build directory — see its S0.0 Step 0
  }
The tool posts an async export job, polls a task endpoint until the task reaches a terminal
status, resolves the resulting package ID, fetches a pre-signed download link, and writes the
zip locally. Typical completion time is 10–60 seconds depending on project size.
