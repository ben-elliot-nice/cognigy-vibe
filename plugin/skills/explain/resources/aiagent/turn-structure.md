## turn-structure — Canonical Cognigy Turn Architecture

### Standard flow structure
  Start
  └── Once
      ├── OnFirstTime (runs once at session start)
      │   ├── Set Context (config, auth flags, etc.)
      │   ├── Code: Build Greeting (builds context.greetingText)
      │   └── Say: Proactive Greeting (outputs context.greetingText)
      └── Afterwards (runs every turn after the first)
          └── AI Agent Job (Concierge)
  End

### Why this matters
Set Context in the main chain runs every turn — resets context on every message.
Set Context in OnFirstTime runs once — persists for the session.
AI Agent Job in Afterwards — never runs on the very first turn (greeting runs instead).

### First-turn signal
input.execution === 1 is the canonical way to detect the first turn in a code node.
Do NOT use turn-count variables or session flags for this.
  if (input.execution === 1) {
    // first turn setup
  }

### Proactive greeting pattern
  // Code node:
  const name = context.shortTermMemory?.customerName || 'there';
  context.greetingText = `Hello ${name}, I'm Vera. How can I help you today?`;
  // Then: Say node outputs {{context.greetingText}}
This guarantees on-brand, correctly personalised greeting with zero LLM latency.

### Flow close pattern
  Once → next → End
The Once node's "next" pointer leads to End for clean termination.
Do NOT put any nodes after End or the flow will loop.

### Context reset prevention
If context resets every turn, check:
  1. Set Context is in main chain (move to OnFirstTime)
  2. Flow is being reset by a goTo with reset=true
  3. Multiple flows calling into each other with shared context

### Programmatic child branch population
Once nodes auto-create OnFirstTime and Afterwards branches — do NOT attempt to create
them manually (returns HTTP 400 "operation conflicts with constraints").

To add a node to a child branch via the API:
1. GET the flow chart to find the Once node and its childIds
2. The childIds array contains the branch marker _ids (onFirstExecution and afterwards)
3. Create your node with mode="append", target="<branch-marker-id>"

The node inserts as a sibling after the branch marker — it renders inside that branch section.
Do NOT use appendChild mode on a branch marker: that nests the node INSIDE the marker, breaking UI rendering.

Full example — adding a Code node to OnFirstTime:
  // Step 1: get_flow_chart to find the Once node
  // Chart shows Once node "once-abc" with childIds ["onfirst-xyz", "after-xyz"]
  //   "onfirst-xyz" = OnFirstTime branch marker (_id)
  //   "after-xyz"   = Afterwards branch marker (_id)

  // Step 2: create the Code node as sibling after OnFirstTime marker
  cognigy_create(resource_type="node", body={
    "flowId": "<flow-id>",
    "type": "code",
    "label": "Load Guest Profile",
    "mode": "append",
    "target": "onfirst-xyz",
    "config": {"code": "const profile = await api.httpRequest({...});"}
  })

Same rule as IF node branches — mode="append" after the branch marker, not appendChild into it.
See node-positioning for the appendChild vs append distinction.
